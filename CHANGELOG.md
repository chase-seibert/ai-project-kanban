# Changelog

## 2026-09-30

- Prevented concurrent Mac listener starts from binding twice to port 47928.
  Port conflicts now explain how to release the port before retrying.
- Added a saved phone automatic-sync toggle plus board pull-to-refresh and an
  explicit Sync Now action that work even when automatic syncing is off.

## 2026-09-29

- Replaced prototype code with independently identified multi-project boards.
- Rebuilt both native interfaces: top-aligned lanes, quick capture, drag/drop,
  card reordering, task detail, activity, and explicit project creation.
- Fixed iPhone compatibility-mode sizing with generated launch configuration.
- Added versioned SwiftData/SQLite, legacy import, preserved backups,
  export/empty-library restore, and manual-task undo/redo.
- Added Codex app-server integration with durable runs, progress, logs, approvals,
  session links, stop/retry, structured outcomes, and dirty-checkout isolation.
- Added Latest Luna · High model defaults, project/task overrides, model
  catalog validation, and saved model/effort snapshots for confirmed runs and retries.
- Added model/persistence regressions and offline runner integration fixtures.
- Added an experimental local Wi-Fi sync path: temporary-code pairing, encrypted
  protocol messages, authoritative Mac receipts, phone replica cache, and a
  durable phone outbox. Pairing is automatic from the temporary code. Added a
  Connection tab on phone and in Mac Settings with progress, editable endpoint,
  and bounded timestamped network-exchange logs. The Mac listener resumes on
  app launch after the user has enabled it. Device-level acceptance remains open.

## 2026-09-28

- Created the StageChase macOS and iOS SwiftUI app targets.
- Added the shared fixed-stage data model, local persistence, revisioned task
  transitions, activity history, and structured automation references.
- Added board/task editing interfaces for Mac and iPhone.
- Added Swift package tests and Makefile build/test/simulator/device targets.
